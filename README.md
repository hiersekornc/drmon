### what is this
This is a set of computercraft LUA scripts that monitors everything about a draconic reactors and storage, with a couple features to help keep it from exploding
NB: This is for Minecraft 1.12.2. You will need to answer some questions on console during install


### tutorial
1.7.10 you can find a very well made youtube tutorial on how to set this up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rBhQP1xqEU) , thank you [The MindCrafters](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2wEy4_BbYpAQcgvN26OaQ)

I have not created a tutorial for 1.12.2 yet.
